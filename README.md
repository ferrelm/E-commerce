## Aditional Steps

Refactoring time!

Make sure your code is clean, easy to undestand and behaves as expected!
- Lookout for large methods, classes or complex code that can be split into cleaner units
- Care about names: is the name of your functions, classes and variables consistent and self explanatory?
- Make sure you deal with errors and edge cases:
- Your API should never return 500 error
- Your Service should never die unexpectedly
- Validate your inputs! (what happens if the user send a string in a number field?)
- Return Bad Request with a proper validation message to guide the API user
- What happens when your code fails? Are you catching exceptions, logging errors and sending the appropriate
message to your users?
